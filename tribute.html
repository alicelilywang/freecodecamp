          <div class="text-left" id="tribute-info">
            <p>When <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audrey_Hepburn" id="tribute-link">Audrey Hepburn</a> came to collect her Oscar for 1953’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Holiday">Roman Holiday</a>, she kept her eyes looking downward, her exaggerated lashes fluttering on her cheeks, as she slowly but deliberately spoke her speech. Her reluctance to make eye contact with anyone in the crowd or play to the camera drew audiences’ eyes to the neckline of her dress. The lace fabric sweeps across her collarbone in a straight line in a way that is at once demure (the lace!) and thoroughly modern (the neckline!).</p>

<p>According to her biographer, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barry_Paris">Barry Paris</a>, Audrey wasn’t an Oscars shoe-in. It was From Here to Eternity Deborah Kerr’s year. But the Academy proves time and time again that it loves an ingénue, and no one has ever been more of an ingénue than Audrey in Roman Holiday. She entered the public consciousness as a princess, the royal America never had, and could never quite shake that image. An article about her love life in a 1953 issue of Screenland notes that Audrey “has been described as ‘romantic; fey; puckish; whimsical; demure; mischievous; pert; naive; passionate; captivating; beguiling; sensitive.’” It gushes that she’s “gifted with a long-legged grace, a mobile face with big, slated dark eyes, and a rich, slightly clotted voice.” Those were a lot of adjectives to live up to.</p>

<p>Now Audrey exists in cultural memory more as idea than as an actress. Casual fans likely ignore her cunning screen presence and the way she balanced wit, heart, and pathos. They forget that, in Roman Holiday, she made new love feel achingly real. To some, Audrey’s main legacy is harmful “thinspiration,” focusing solely on her slight appearance, her weight. Admittedly, I first fell for Audrey as a young teenager simply because of how she emanated a timeless grace that I was desperate to emulate. Current stars are still held to her standards, and history remembers her in superlative.</p>

  <blockquote> "For beautiful eyes, look for the good in others; for beautiful lips, speak only words of kindness; and for poise, walk with the knowledge that you are never alone."
            </blockquote>
<p>But style was a crucial reason why Roman Holiday worked so well. Audrey’s Princess Ann rebels against her circumstances, but her rejection of staid courtly garments turns her into a mid-20th-century ideal. When Ann chops off her long locks for a gamine cut that’s just longer than a pixie, the hairdresser asks, “You musician maybe? You artist? Painter?” She shakes her head. “I know,” he declares. “You, model.” In the movie, Audrey both cultivated and undermined ideas of beauty. The outfit she primarily wears — white collared shirt, belted skirt — emphasizes her tiny waist while maintaining an air of boyishness. The dress she chose for the Academy Awards somehow falls in between this casual ensemble and the more ornate royal gowns on display. (More on that later.) It’s sprightly but appears delicate, like it would shatter if you touched it.</p>

<p>The provenance of the dress is messy. It’s widely considered the first time the actress would publicly appear in a piece designed by <a target="_blank" href= "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubert_de_Givenchy">Hubert de Givenchy</a>, and certainly, it looks like something Givenchy would have made. But Kerry Taylor, who sold the dress through her eponymous auction house in 2011, tells a different story. “It is definitely not by Givenchy,” she wrote in an email to me. “It was a dress designed for the film by Edith Head which Audrey had remodeled for the Oscar ceremony — a ‘make do and mend’ mentality that she had inherited from those years of hardship during the war.”</p>

<p>Audrey removed the stately suited bodice that appeared in the final scene and added the Givenchy-influenced boatneck, Taylor explained. This would be in keeping with Oscar trends of the day. By that point, Head had been appointed the Academy’s official fashion consultant, and, according to Patty Fox’s book Star Style at the Academy Awards: A Century of Glamour, nominees would often nod to their characters with their gowns. Still, regardless of who was responsible — Givenchy or Head — what was perfectly clear on that Oscar night was that Audrey herself was taking control of her look.</p>

<p>In the lead-up to Oscar night, a conflict between Head and Givenchy unfolded behind the scenes on Sabrina, Audrey’s Roman Holiday follow-up. By all accounts, Audrey orchestrated it. Head, the costume supervisor for Paramount, was reportedly eager to tackle the project, writing in her memoir that she considered the romantic comedy a “perfect setup” for her work. Different sources tell the story in slightly different ways, but the crux of it was that Audrey, dissatisfied with Head’s solo work, implored director Billy Wilder to let her go to Paris and woo Givenchy.</p>


<p>In Made for Each Other: Fashion and the Academy Awards, Browyn Cosgrave writes that Audrey “went above Head,” arguing that it made sense that her titular character would return from Paris, where she is sent after a suicide attempt, with a wardrobe of couture. (Givenchy, meanwhile, only first entertained meeting the young actress in his studio thinking she was Katharine Hepburn.) Despite Givenchy’s skepticism with the confident unknown, Audrey was persistent. “I told Audrey that I had very few workers and I needed all my hands to help me with my next collection, which I had to show very soon. But she insisted, ‘Please, please, there must be something I can try on,’” he once reminisced in an interview with Vanity Fair. The Givenchy version of events found Hepburn selecting items from the spring/summer 1953 collection, among them a black number with a neckline that echoes the one on the Oscar dress. She liked it, per VF, because of how it highlighted qualities on her body she thought were assets (her shoulders) and concealed what, in her opinion, was not (her, in the words of Givenchy himself, “skinny collarbone”).</p>

<p>Both Head and Givenchy had misgivings about the way they were treated on Sabrina. In a 2010 Los Angeles Times piece excerpted from the memoir of Jean-Pierre Dorléac, Head maintained that she was responsible for the costumes. Meanwhile, Givenchy was frustrated to find his name excised from the movie’s credits. Historically, Givenchy championed over Head in the Audrey business. The designer’s name became linked with Audrey’s, even inspiring tomes about their collaboration. Givenchy went on to design more memorable looks for her in Funny Face, Charade, and the dorm-room staple of her pictures: Breakfast at Tiffany’s. He’d even get credit for the Oscar dress. When Emma Stone won in Givenchy, the brand confirmed that she was the first Best Actress since Audrey to do so. The breathless desire to link Emma to Audrey only goes to show how much influence the latter still holds over what we consider glamorous.</p>

<p>But really, this all just proved Audrey’s savviness. By enlisting Givenchy — even if it was at the expense of Head, who did her part to cultivate the Hepburn milieu — she embraced the identity as fashion icon that would leave a lasting mark on the red carpet. In The Complete Book of Oscar Fashion: 75 Years of Glamour on the Red Carpet, Reeve Chace writes that Audrey “defined the new look of chic in her lacy tea-length gown of 1954.” She seems almost meek on that stage accepting her trophy. When she first climbs the stairs, she even walks in the wrong direction. She may have been an ingénue, but Audrey was just beginning her reign.</p>
